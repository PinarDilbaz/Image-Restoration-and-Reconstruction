# Image-Restoration-and-Reconstruction
Objectives:
The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize yourselves with the image restoration techniques
(including spatial and frequency domain). Due to the hardware malfunction or other problems during
image acquisition, there may be some additive or periodic noise patterns in the images. These can be
identified and eliminated in spatial/frequency domain. For this assignment you are given images with
noise of different types and characteristics. Your job is to investigate the given images in spatial and
frequency domains, identify the abnormalities and design filters to eliminate them.
